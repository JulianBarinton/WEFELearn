# Biogas + x
## Description
Combining sources and end-uses of the water, energy, food, and waste sectors, biogas systems can be considered as integrated and multifunctional WEF system. Biogas can be produced from biodegradable materials such as animal dung, energy crops, weeds, food waste, forest residues, and sewage. Together with water, the raw material is fed into an anaerobic digester (see figure). There, the material is degraded by microorganisms (methanogens). The degradation products are biogas and digestate.
The biogas can be used for cooking, as fuel for combined heat and power (CHP) plants, or processed to biomethane and be used as fuel for vehicles or be fed into the gas grid. In CHP plants, biogas fuels a combustion engine that drives a generator to produce electricity. A heat recovery unit takes up the heat of the exhaust gases, transmits it to steam or hot water. The heat can be used to heat the digester or for adjacent district heating. The digestate from the anaerobic digester can be used as fertilizer, soil amendment, or livestock bedding ([Tanigwawa, 2017](https://www.eesi.org/files/FactSheet_Biogas_2017.09.pdf)).

## WEF Interconnections
Biogas units recycle biodegradable material from the food, water, and waste sector (wastewater, food waste, plant residues, weeds, animal manure for production). As an outcome, they can provide energy in the form of heat, electricity, and mobility, as well as fertilizer for the agricultural sector. Moreover, biogas can be stored. Thus, CHP units can dispatch their energy generation, providing highly required flexible electricity production for grids with high intermitting renewable energy production (solar & wind). 
Main WEF nexus trade-offs are additional water consumption, land requirements occurring when cultivating energy crops (e.g., maize, sorghum, wheat) ([Pacetti et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.084)), as well as energy and labor demands for the transport of the substrate.

## Variants
The efficiency of biogas production can be increased by co-digesting the organic input material in specific mixture formulas (e.g., wastewater with food waste ([Al-Addous et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/en12010032); [Montecchio et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.07.036)). Further, biogas production can be combined with other productive uses like water purification. Therefore, the CHP unit's heat is used for membrane distillation of the source water ([Khan et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2014.03.004)).
